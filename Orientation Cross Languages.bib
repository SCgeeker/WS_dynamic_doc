However, after watching a video of a simulated bank robbery, participants who verbally described the robber were 25\% worse at identifying the robber in a lineup than were participants who instead listed U.S. states and capitals\textemdash{}this has been termed the ``verbal overshadowing'' effect (Schooler \& Engstler-Schooler, 1990). More recent studies suggested that this effect might be substantially smaller than first reported. Given uncertainty about the effect size, the influence of this finding in the memory literature, and its practical importance for police procedures, we conducted two collections of preregistered direct replications (RRR1 and RRR2) that differed only in the order of the description task and a filler task. In RRR1, when the description task immediately followed the robbery, participants who provided a description were 4\% less likely to select the robber than were those in the control condition. In RRR2, when the description was delayed by 20 min, they were 16\% less likely to select the robber. These findings reveal a robust verbal overshadowing effect that is strongly influenced by the relative timing of the tasks. The discussion considers further implications of these replications for our understanding of verbal overshadowing.},

They then either named a picture of that object (Experiments 1 and 3) or decided whether the object had been mentioned in the sentence (Experiment 2).

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Participants responded faster to pictures that matched the orientation or shape implied by the sentence, replicating the original findings. The effect was larger and stronger for shape than orientation. Participants also responded faster to pictures that matched the color implied by the sentence, whereas the original studies obtained $<$italic$>$mis$<$/italic$>$match advantages.

Further evidence suggests that simulation is typically situated, with the situated character of experience in the environment being reflected in the situated character of the representations that underlie simulation. A basic architecture is sketched of how the brain implements situated simulation. Within this framework, simulators implement the concepts that underlie knowledge, and situated conceptualizations capture patterns of multi-modal simulation associated with frequently experienced situations. A pattern completion inference mechanism uses current perception to activate situated conceptualizations that produce predictions via simulations on relevant modalities. Empirical findings from perception, action, working memory, conceptual processing, language and social cognition illustrate how this framework produces the extensive prediction that characterizes natural intelligence.},

This literature implies that subjects perform the task by imagining the rotation of one of the stimuli to the orientation of the other. This literature has spawned several theories of mental representation. These theories imply that mental representations cannot be both orientation-free and handedness-specific. We present four experiments that demonstrate the contrary: mental representations can be both orientation-free and handedness-specific. In Experiment 1 we serendipitously discovered a version of R. N. Shepard and J. Metzler${'}$s (1971) "mental rotation" task in which subjects accurately discover the handedness of a stimulus without using "mental rotation," i.e., in which reaction time to compare the handedness of two forms is not a function of the angular disparity between the two forms. In Experiment 2 we generalize this finding to different experimental procedures. In Experiment 3 we replicate this finding with a much larger group of subjects. In Experiment 4 we show that when we preclude the formation of an orientation-free representation by never repeating a polygon, subjects carry out the handedness comparison task by performing "mental rotation."},

Embodied cognition theory assumes that while sentence comprehension, readers would activate the perceptual mental representation of what they read, such as object shape, orientation etc. Some of previous studies that including implicit object color information in language comprehension support the hypothesis of embodied cognition theory, however others do not. The current research intended to investigate mental simulation of implied object color during sentence reading, which the prototypicality of object color is considered. The current experiment is 2\texttimes{}2 two factors within-subjects design. One of the independent variables is the object color implied in the sentence (typical color or atypical color of the object); the other is sentence-picture matching condition (match or mismatch). The dependent variables are the reaction times and the brain electrical activities (N400 as index) when participants judge pictures after reading sentences. During the experiment, participants first read sentences implying a typical or atypical color of one object and then watched the pictures. They were asked to judge whether the object in the picture was mentioned in previous sentences. All of subjects' reaction times were analyzed using 2\texttimes{}2 repeated measures ANOVAs. The result showed that reaction times of the pictures after sentences implying typical color of objects were faster than those after sentences implying atypical color. Reaction times of pictures in matched condition were faster than those in mismatched condition. After all, the interaction effect between two factors was not significant. Besides behavioral results, subjects' ERPs data were analyzed using 2\texttimes{}5\texttimes{}5 repeated measures ANOVAs separately in both cases of typical color sentence and atypical color sentence. Analyzing factors were sentence-picture matching condition (match or mismatch), brain posteriority (frontal, fronto-central, central, centro-parietal, parietal), and hemisphere laterality (left temporal, left, midline, right, right temporal). The results showed that, after reading sentences implying typical color, the peaks of N400 elicited in the mismatch condition were more negative compared to the match condition. On the contrary, after reading sentences implying atypical color, the peaks of N400 elicited between the match condition and mismatch condition were similar. Both behavioral results and ERP findings together suggested that, readers do activate perceptual mental representation of objects and their properties during sentence comprehension, even characters of objects were not directly mentioned. More importantly, the prototypicality of object color implied in the sentence has influence on the specific activation of the object color representation. When reading sentences implying objects' atypical colors, mental representation of both typical and atypical color were activated, therefore had different impacts on the sentence comprehension and other related cognitive processing. The current experiment is 2\texttimes{}2 two factors within-subjects design. One of the independent variables is the object color implied in the sentence (typical color or atypical color of the object); the other is sentence-picture matching condition (match or mismatch).

All of subjects' reaction times were analyzed using 2\texttimes{}2 repeated measures ANOVAs, with the object color implied in the sentence (typical color or atypical color) and sentence-picture matching condition (match or mismatch) as factors. The result showed the main effect of sentence version was significant, reaction times of the pictures after sentences implying typical color of objects were faster than those after sentences implying atypical color; the main effect of sentence-picture matching condition was significant, reaction times of pictures in matched condition were faster than those in mismatched condition; after all, the interaction effect between two factors was not significant. Besides behavioral results, All of subjects' ERPs data were analyzed using 2\texttimes{}5\texttimes{}5 repeated measures ANOVAs separately in both cases of typical color sentence and atypical color sentence. Analyzing factors were sentence-picture matching condition (match or mismatch), brain posteriority (frontal, fronto-central, central, centro-parietal, parietal), and hemisphere laterality (left temporal, left, midline, right, right temporal). The results showed that after reading sentences implying typical color the main effect of sentence-picture matching condition was significant at the 300-500ms interval. The peaks of N400 elicited in the mismatch condition were more negative compared to the match condition. On the contrary, after reading sentences implying atypical color the main effect of sentence-picture matching condition was not significant at the 300-500ms interval.

In order to test whether strategic imagery may explain previous findings, language comprehenders first read a list of sentences in which objects were mentioned. Only once the complete list had been read was recognition memory tested with pictures. Recognition performance was better if the orientation or shape of the object matched that implied by the sentence, both immediately after reading the complete list of sentences and after a 45-min delay. These results suggest that previously found match effects were not due to strategic imagery and show that details of sensorimotor simulations are retained over longer periods.},

According to perceptual symbol theories, the complete representation of an object, called a simulation, should reflect physical characteristics of the object. Amodal theories, in contrast, do not make this prediction. We tested the hypothesis, derived from perceptual symbol theories, that people mentally represent the orientation of an object implied by a verbal description. Orientation (vertical-horizontal) was manipulated by having participants read a sentence that implicitly suggested a particular orientation for an object. Then recognition latencies to pictures of the object in each of the two orientations were measured. Pictures matching the orientation of the object implied by the sentence were responded to faster than pictures that did not match the orientation. This finding is interpreted as offering support for theories positing perceptual symbol systems.},

He was simply suggesting a number of system properties that are typical of modular systems. I argue that it is nevertheless possible to derive a useful definition of modularity from the kinds of arguments put forward by Fodor: A cognitive system is modular when and only when it is domain-specific. Given any such proposed module, the other features of modularity discussed by Fodor should be dealt with as empirical issues: for each feature (innateness, for example), it is an empirical question whether or not the proposed module has that feature.},

The BOSS is currently the largest existing photo bank providing norms for more than 15 dimensions (e.g. familiarity, visual complexity, manipulability, etc.), making the BOSS an extremely useful research tool and a mean to homogenize scientific data worldwide. The first phase of the BOSS was completed in 2010, and contained 538 normative photos. The second phase of the BOSS project presented in this article, builds on the previous phase by adding 930 new normative photo stimuli. New categories of concepts were introduced, including animals, building infrastructures, body parts, and vehicles and the number of photos in other categories was increased. All new photos of the BOSS were normalized relative to their name, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. The availability of these norms is a precious asset that should be considered for characterizing the stimuli as a function of the requirements of research and for controlling for potential confounding effects.},

Alario and Ferrand (1999) were closely followed in that the pictures were standardized on six variables: name agreement, image agreement, conceptual familiarity, visual complexity, image variability, and age of acquisition. Objective frequency measures are also provided for the most common names associated with the pictures. Comparative analyses between our results and the norms obtained in other, similar studies are reported. Finally, naming latencies corresponding to the set of pictures were also collected from French native speakers, and correlational/multiple-regression analyses were performed on naming latencies. This new set of standardized pictures is available on the Internet (http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/bases/pictures/) and should be of great use to researchers when they select pictorial stimuli.},

dynamic, unfolding sequence of actions, whereas the same behavior described using perfective aspect (i.e., what a

that this finding has implications for legal decision making, coupled with the absence of other direct replication 
attempts, motivated this registered replication report (RRR). Multiple laboratories carried out 12 direct replication

And second, mental simulation of perceptual features should be multimodal, like actual perception of such features. In Experiment 1, we found that language about objects at different distances modulated the size of visually simulated objects. In Experiment 2, we found a similar effect for volume in the auditory modality. These experiments lend support to the view that language-driven mental simulation encodes experiencer-specific spatial details. The fact that we obtained similar simulation effects for two different modalities\textemdash{}audition and vision\textemdash{}confirms the multimodal nature of mental simulations during language understanding.},

Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie this process. Research on human action understanding shows that perceiving another's actions results in automatic activation of the motor system in the observer, which then affects the observer's understanding of the actor's goals. We ask here whether perceiving another's gesture can similarly result in automatic activation of the motor system in the observer. In Experiment 1, we first establish a new procedure that uses listener response times to study how gesture impacts sentence comprehension. In Experiment 2, we use this procedure, in conjunction with a secondary motor task, to investigate whether the listener's motor system is involved in this process. We show that moving arms and hands (but not legs and feet) interferes with the listener's ability to use information conveyed in a speaker's hand gestures. Our data thus suggest that understanding gesture relies, at least in part, on the listener's own motor system.},

The number of objects varied from one to four. In Experiment 1, participants read statements such as three dogs. In Experiment 2, they read sentences such as three dogs were wandering in the street. In both experiments, the verification speed revealed the interaction between response and numerical congruency. The verification times for concept-object match were faster when there was also numerical congruence (compared with incongruence) between the number word and quantity. On the other hand, there was no difference between numerical congruence and incongruence when the concept and object mismatched. The results are interpreted as evidence for the symbol grounding of number words in perceptual representation of small quantities, that is, quantities falling in the subitization range.},

Faster verification times on matching trials (match advantage) are considered supportive to the notion that readers perform mental simulations during sentence comprehension. This study advances this work by applying a within-subjects design to the SPV-task, enabling us to directly address the strength of and correlation between the match advantages for the properties shape, size, colour, and orientation. Results showed varying match advantages with colour showing the strongest effect, and no match advantage for orientation. Shape, size, and colour were significantly correlated, whereas there were no significant correlations with orientation. These findings suggest that interpretations of match advantages could benefit from a re-evaluation of mental simulation accountsby distinguishing between intrinsic (shape, size, and colour) and extrinsic (orientation) object properties.},

design is any experimental design that can be described by some variety of ANOVA model.
Surprisingly, a power analysis program for general ANOVA designs did not exist until now.
PANGEA can estimate power for designs that consist of any number of factors, each with any
number of levels; any factor can be considered fixed or random; and any possible pattern of
nesting or crossing of the factors is allowed. I demonstrate how PANGEA can be used to
estimate power for anything from simple between- and within-subjects designs, to more
complicated designs with multiple random factors (e.g., multilevel designs and crossed-randomeffects
designs). I document the statistical theory underlying PANGEA and describe some
experimental features to be added in the near future.},

(2013) recommended fitting 'maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atypical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas the Open Science Collaboration (2015) could replicate less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology. Researchers are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

However, the effect is rather small in a sentence-picture verification task compared to published effects of other visual dimensions, such as shape, size, and color. The present study examines whether object size moderates the orientation effect. Theoretical considerations of how we interact with manipulable versus non-manipulable objects lead us to predict a smaller effect for manipulable objects than for non-manipulable objects. We furthermore predict the generalization of this pattern across languages (Chinese, Dutch, and English). Furthermore, we seek converging evidence in a picture-picture verification task that compares the verification times between pairs of rotated or non-rotated objects.  Longer verification times for large objects would indicate that these objects require more cognitive effort for mental simulation than small objects, regardless of the presence of language.},

  abstract = {Theories of embodied cognition suggest that conceptual processing relies on the same neural resources that are utilized for perception and action. Evidence for these perceptual simulations comes from neuroimaging and behavioural research, such as demonstrations of somatotopic motor cortex activations following the presentation of action-related words, or facilitation of grasp responses following presentation of object names. However, the interpretation of such effects has been called into question by suggestions that neural activation in modality-specific sensorimotor regions may be epiphenomenal, and merely the result of spreading activations from ``disembodied'', abstracted, symbolic representations. Here, we present two studies that focus on the perceptual modalities of touch and proprioception. We show that in a timed object-comparison task, concurrent tactile or proprioceptive stimulation to the hands facilitates conceptual processing relative to control stimulation. This facilitation occurs only for small, manipulable objects, where tactile and proprioceptive information form part of the multimodal perceptual experience of interacting with such objects, but facilitation is not observed for large, nonmanipulable objects where such perceptual information is uninformative. Importantly, these facilitation effects are independent of motor and action planning, and indicate that modality-specific perceptual information plays a functionally constitutive role in our mental representations of objects, which supports embodied assumptions that concepts are grounded in the same neural systems that govern perception and action.},

We will address this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov's (2008) methodology across all world regions (Africa, Asia, Central America and Mexico, Eastern Europe, Middle East, USA and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Scandinavia, South America, UK, Western Europe, total N $\geq$ 9525) and using a diverse set of face stimuli. If we uncover systematic regional differences in social judgments, this will fundamentally change how social perception research is done and interpreted.

  doi = {10.22599/jesla.39},
  abstract = {Previous  research  suggests  that  native  (L1)  speakers  employ  ``mental  simulations''  for  language 
comprehension. Empirical work shows that intrinsic object properties (shape, size and color) are indeed 
simulated, but the evidence for extrinsic properties (orientation) is less convincing. There is little work 
on simulation in second language (L2) learners, but since they have similar perceptual experiences as 
L1~speakers there is good reason to think that L2 learners too use simulation to comprehend L2~sentences. 
This paper aims to conceptually replicate previous simulation studies into object size and orientation with 
L2 learners (N~=~223) and two L1~speaker control groups (N~=~64). An important difference with previous 
work is that we use language-specific forms indicating size (Spanish augmentative suffixes) and orientation 
(German placement verbs). We expected that language-specific forms would cause simulation for both the 
intrinsic and extrinsic property under investigation. We employed a sentence-picture verification task and 
analyzed Yes/No responses and reaction times (RTs). RT results on mis/match trials reveal no orientation 
effect, but a size match effect. Findings support previous research with null results for orientation and 
add  support  for  size  simulation.  We  suggest  that  future  studies  examine  whether  L2  learners  make 
simulations for both implied and explicit sentences, whether they simulate with or without prior language instruction and whether they also simulate shape and color.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the veracity of psychological research have been growing. Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel research questions or replicate prior research in large, diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time limited), efficient (in that structures and principles are reused for different projects), decentralized, diverse (in both subjects and researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone inside or outside the network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced psychological science will advance understanding of mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematic examination of its generalizability.},

  abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that the sensory and motor systems are activated during conceptual processing. Such results have been interpreted as indicating that concepts, and important aspects of cognition more broadly, are embodied. That conclusion does not follow from the empirical evidence. The reason why is that the empirical evidence can equally be accommodated by a 'disembodied' view of conceptual representation that makes explicit assumptions about spreading activation between the conceptual and sensory and motor systems. At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence. We suggest a middle ground between the embodied and disembodied cognition hypotheses--grounding by interaction. This hypothesis combines the view that concepts are, at some level, 'abstract' and 'symbolic', with the idea that sensory and motor information may 'instantiate' online conceptual processing.},

  abstract = {Societies invest in scientific studies to better understand the world and attempt to harness such improved understanding to address pressing societal problems. Published research, however, can be useful for theory or application only if it is credible. In science, a credible finding is one that has repeatedly survived risky falsification attempts. However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.},

  abstract = {According to the Justified True Belief (JTB) account of knowledge, a person's ability to know something is defined by having a belief that is both justified and true (i.e., knowledge is justified true belief). However, this account fails to consider the role of luck. In 1963, Gettier argued that JTB is insufficient because it does not account for certain situations, called Gettier cases, wherein a person is justified for believing something true but only because of luck. It is unclear whether lay people's intuitions about knowledge lead them to agree with Gettier, such that lay people believe that individuals in these cases lack knowledge (referred to as Gettier intuitions). We attempt to provide a robust estimate of the Gettier intuition effect size by replicating Turri and colleagues' (2015) Experiment 1. The Collaborative Replications and Education Project (CREP) selected this study for replication based on its undergraduate appeal, feasibility, and pedagogical value. However, in light of some inconsistent results, suboptimal designs, and inconsistent evidence for cultural variation (e.g., Machery et al., 2015; Nagel, et al., 2013; Seyedsayamdost et al., 2015; Starman \& Friedman, 2012; Weinberg et al., 2001), the improved methodology of Turri et al. (2015) make it an important study to replicate cross-culturally. Therefore, we propose a multisite collaborative preregistered replication of Turri and colleague's (2015) Experiment 1 (35 labs from 14 countries across 4 continents signed up at time of submission; expected minimum N = 1,500). Results of this study are expected to provide a clearer picture of the Gettier intuition effect size, lay people's theory and practice of knowledge, and potentially cross-cultural similarities and differences.

This multi-laboratory project aims to achieve two objectives. First, we examine the replicability of the match advantage of object orientation across multiple languages and laboratories. Second, we will use a mental rotation task to measure participants' mental imagery after the sentence-picture verification task. The relationship between the participants' performance of the two tasks will provide a cross-linguistic examination of perceptual simulation processes.

  abstract = {Much indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that transformations of mental images are at least in part guided by motor processes, even in the case of images of abstract objects rather than of body parts. For example, rotation may be guided by processes that also prime one to see results of a specific motor action. We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper-Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen motor rotation in a given direction and at a previously-learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental rotation relies on motor processes. First, motor rotation that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, motor rotation modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases motor rotation even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve in the direction of the motor rotation. Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the motor rotation, but also to the motor speed. A change in the speed of motor rotation can correspondingly slow down or speed up the mental rotation.},

  volume = {20},
  issn = {1053-8119},
  abstract = {The functional role of human premotor and primary motor cortex during mental rotation has been studied using functional MRI at 3 T. Fourteen young, male subjects performed a mental rotation task in which they had to decide whether two visually presented cubes could be identical. Exploratory Fuzzy Cluster Analysis was applied to identify brain regions with stimulus-related time courses. This revealed one dominant cluster which included the parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that showed signal enhancement during the whole stimulus presentation period, reflecting cognitive processing. A second cluster, encompassing the contralateral primary motor cortex, showed activation exclusively after the button press response. This clear separation was possible in 3 subjects only, however. Based on these exploratory results, the hypothesis that primary motor cortex activity was related to button pressing only was tested using a parametric approach via a random-effects group analysis over all 14 subjects in SPM99. The results confirmed that the stimulus response via button pressing causes activation in the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area while parietal cortex and mesial regions rostral to the supplementary motor area are recruited for the actual mental rotation process.},

  title = {Mental and Manual Rotation},
  volume = {24},
  issn = {0096-1523},
  abstract = {The relation between mental and manual rotation was investigated in 2 experiments. Experiment 1 compared the response times (RTs) of mental rotation about 4 axes in space with the RTs shown in the same task when participants were allowed to reorient the stimuli by means of rotational hand movements. For the 3 Cartesian axes, RT functions were quantitatively indistinguishable. Experiment 2 investigated interference between mental rotation and 4 kinds of simultaneously executed hand movements that did not reorient the stimuli. Interference was observed only when axes of manual and mental rotation coincided in space. Regardless of the hand used, concordant rotational directions facilitated, whereas discordant directions inhibited, mental rotation. The results suggest that mental object rotation and rotatory object manipulation share a common process that is thought to control he dynamics of both imagined and actually performed object reorientation.},
